# Maze Robot Evolution

A simple evolution system for simulated robots in [Processing](https://processing.org/).

*Please note this project is in development.*

## How to run

Use [Processing](https://processing.org/) to run this sketch

## Keyboard and mouse shortcuts:

| Key(s)            | Function                    |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`| Manual robot control        |
| `Q`               | Toggle auto drive for robots|
| `F`               | Center on best scored robot |
